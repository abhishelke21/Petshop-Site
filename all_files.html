            <h5 class="card-title">Cockatiel</h5>
            <p class="card-text">These medium-sized birds are simply a delight to keep. Members of the parrot family,
                these Australian natives are known for their surprisingly advanced whistling and singing abilities.
                While cockatiels are capable of learning to talk, many owners find that their birds prefer to whistle
                and to mimic quirky sounds such as the ringing of a telephone. These birds are available in increasingly
                diverse color combinations and have an average life expectancy of between 15 and 20 years.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Finch</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Finches and canaries (a species of finch) are ever-popular companion birds. With most
                varieties measuring just five inches or less, finches and canaries require less space than almost any
                other pet bird species. Unlike the parrots, which are all hard-beaked hookbill birds, finches and
                canaries are known as softbills or waxbill birds; they have somewhat pliable, waxy beaks. These little
                birds thrive in small flocks and generally pay little attention to humans which makes them perfect pets
                for those who love to watch birds but want a pet that requires less interaction. A finch or canary can
                live up to 10 years if it is well cared for.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Lovebirds are one of the smallest parrot species. These colorful little birds should
                not be overlooked in favor of larger, more demanding parrots as lovebirds possess all the intelligence
                and personality of the largest of macaws. These birds are fairly quiet companions, making them ideal for
                those who live in apartments or condominiums. The lovebird has a life expectancy of up to 20 years.</p>

            <p class="card-text">The monk parakeet or quaker is actually a small parrot. It is well known for its
                ability to build a large vocabulary or words and phrases. The more you verbally explain what you are
                doing around the cage, the more this bird will pick up on the words for things and how to mimics those
                words. Monk parakeets have a life expectancy of 20 to 30 years.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Dove</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Doves are known for their sweet and gentle dispositions. Unlike the hookbill parrots,
                softbills doves rarely try to bite or do damage with their beaks. Still, it always helps to use calm and
                positive socialization and bonding techniques with these birds. Doves can be a good choice as a pet for
                older children who understand how to be calm and gentle with companion animals. Doves need companionship
                too, and if kept alone indoors, they should be allowed plenty of free flight time out of the cage to
                interact with human caretakers. Mirrors and swings inside a dove's enclosure are a good idea. </p>

            <p class="card-text">From the tropical forests of Ecuador and Peru, parrotlets are genetically most closely
                related to the much larger Amazon parrot. Even though these birds are tiny, they have the same
                temperament and intelligence as their larger cousins. Relatively new to captivity, a parrotlet's wild
                streak is still intact. Without early proper handling, parrotlets can become competitive. Because they
                can be aggressive with other birds, territorial fights might break out during feeding time; hence, they
                often do better when kept by themselves. When miniature parrots act fearlessly, that can also get them
                into trouble in a home with dogs and cats. Feisty parrotlets may not back down from a confrontation with
                your furry pets. These diminutive parrotlets have a lifespan of up to 30 years.</p>

            <p class="card-text">African Grays have been said to be the most intelligent of birds with some boasting
                very large vocabularies. Because these birds are so smart, they tend to be demanding pets that will get
                bored and depressed very quickly if not stimulated for at least five hours per day. But if you are
                looking for a highly intelligent and affectionate forever friend, the African Gray may be a fit. Grays
                are amazing birds that are easily trained once you learn the training techniques of positive
                reinforcement and operant conditioning...</p>
